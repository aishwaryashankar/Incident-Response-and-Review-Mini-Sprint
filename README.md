# WiCyS and Clicked: Incident Response and Review Mini Sprint
### Aishwarya Shankar

In this Mini Sprint, I stepped into the shoes of a cybersecurity professional responsible for handling and mitigating threats based on the NIST Incident Response Process Framework.

## Objective
The scenario for this sprint is the following:
I've been hired to come in as a security analyst on a team working for a company which recently flagged some unusual network activity that has raised alarms. The senior management is taking this incident very seriously, given the medical data contained on the network. As a security analyst for the company, my task is to identify the nature of this alert, its potential impact, suggest mitigation strategies, and compile a review, following the NIST Incident Response Process framework.

## Deliverables
1. Identification and Investigation: I analyzed several Windows Event logs from hosts on the company's network to determine the scope and magnitude of the incident, categorize its nature, and document initial findings.
2. Response, Containment, and Eradication: I created an incident response plan to prevent further damage and eliminate the threat from the environment. I also developed a long-term plan for the company to enhance its security posture.
3. Post-Incident Review: Following the containment and eradication of the incident, I conducted a thorough post-incident review and compiled a report for relevant stakeholders. The report is designed to highlight the incident details, response actions taken, extract lessons, refine procedures, and prepare for potential future incidents.
